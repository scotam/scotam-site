  <p>Most people aren’t a fit with Scottish American and in fact they don’t want to be. Those people like to be managed and they like boundaries. Standardized testing served them well. If you like it when someone else takes responsibility, when you make a mistake and you can look to someone else and know you have a boss….this isn’t the environment for you. At Scottish American producers start their own offices, pick their own teams and create their own businesses. We don’t have managers. Our chief gopher is a producer, everyone is a producer, because the best producers don’t need managers and managers can’t produce. We reward our producers with the pay managers are paid elsewhere. Oh and we built our own IT system. Built by producers, for producers, it works on any device, from anywhere. Paperless? That’s not technology….that’s progress from the 1990s. Try your email within your own system where everything is drag and drop. Oh and if you want a feature upgrade…..you tell the gopher and he goes and builds it. Knowledge of the different E&S markets is beneficial but not mandatory. We offer very competitive salary and benefits, including medical, dental, vision coverage and a 401k. We are a team – we work as a team and we hang out as a team. If you want to get a feel for whether you’d fit then see our cartoon profiles.
