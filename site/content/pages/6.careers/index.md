Some people like to be managed. They like having a boss and operate better with structure, boundaries and hierarchies. That’s perfectly fine. But Scottish American isn’t the best fit for them then. 

At Scottish American, there are no bosses. We’re constantly evolving, aren’t bound by structure, and operate as a network, not as a hierarchy. Here, producers start their own offices, recruit their own teams, and build their own businesses. Our employees are self-motivated to help each other build this company for each other.

We offer very competitive salaries and benefits, including medical, dental, and vision coverage, and 401k. 

If you want to get a feel for whether you’d fit at Scottish American, see our cartoon profiles. Then get in touch with us at rockstars@scottishamerican.com or (714) 550-5050.
