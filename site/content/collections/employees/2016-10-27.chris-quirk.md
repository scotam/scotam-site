biography: 'Chris was born into the insurance industry, and hails from the Lone Star State. He graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a BA in Plan II Honors and a BS in Chemistry. Now with over 15 years of Insurance Technology experience, Chris is looking forward to turning this knowlege to GOLD. When not code slaying, he spends his spare time proving that Disco is not dead by spinning jams on the 1’s & 2’s or putting his Chemistry degree to “good use” and is up to his elbows in hops brewing an IPA for his next Saturday Night Fever party.'
