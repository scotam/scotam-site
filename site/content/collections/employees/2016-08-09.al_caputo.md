biography: >
  Al started in the insurance business over 30 years ago because he had a wife, a child, a mortgage,
  and lost his job proving the Chief Gopher’s point that if you are not born into insurance you go
  into it by accident or kicking and screaming. Al’s career has been on both the carrier and agency
  sides of the business specializing in marketing and personal lines. Al is very active in various
  insurance organizations like the PIA and CIBGNY. Al spends a lot of his spare time hacking up any
  golf course he can find and after 40 years finally got that elusive hole-in-one.
