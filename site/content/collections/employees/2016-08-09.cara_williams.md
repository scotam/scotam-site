biography: "Cara joined Team Roseville in October of 2013, bringing with her a strong work ethic and positive attitude. When she isn't cranking out renewals or having Nerf gun fights with her co-workers she enjoys painting, sculpting, and listening her Wu-Tang Clan vinyl. The only thing she loves more than coffee is sloths."
