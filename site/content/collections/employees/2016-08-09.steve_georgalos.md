biography: >
  Steve came to BBA in 2012 as a commercial lines underwriter after spending 8 years working for
  another wholesaler. He thinks underwriting is nothing like brain surgery. So as you can tell he does
  like to state the obvious at times. He claims to have the nicest hair in the insurance industry and
  sometimes thinks he plays guitar for an 80â€™s rock band. In his free time he likes to coach youth
  basketball and play softball. His players and teammates think he should keep his day job.
