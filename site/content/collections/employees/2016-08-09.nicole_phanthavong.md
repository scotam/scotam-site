biography: 'Nicole has 6 years of mortgage insurance experience, but has ventured on to a different side of insurance and is excited to learn about E&S.   She loves meeting new people and making new friends.  Her passions in life include sports, dance, traveling, and eating really really spicy food. Also, she enjoys working in San Francisco,  as it is her place of birth and upbringing.  The word "hella" comes out in her conversations more than any other words. [Urban Dictionary: A multi-purpose word invented by people in Northern California, indigenous to the Bay Area.  Adjective: To describe a lot of something or something good.]'
