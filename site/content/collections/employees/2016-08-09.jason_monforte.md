biography: 'Jason joined Scottish American at the start of 2015 with 11 years of personal lines experience, specializing in high net worth accounts. Nicknamed "The Big Donk" by teammates - when he is not hitting softballs farther than the eye can see, he can be found at home on Long Island teaching his two young children about Pittsburgh Penguins hockey and heavy metal music...then explaining to his wife why a 1 year old is wearing a Slayer t-shirt and a 3 year old girl requests Metallica in the car.'
