biography: 'Brent is a Buckeye (or from Ohio for all you non mid-westerners) that 6 years ago transplanted to sunny San Diego with his then girlfriend turned fiancee turned wife. As an avid sports fan, he would run through a wall for his beloved Cleveland Indians and Browns. The ability to do such things come from his years as a rugby player for Bowling Green State University. He has now decided to use his head for more rewarding endeavors, such as underwriting and producing business for Yates & Associates.'
