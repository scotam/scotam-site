  How many Crafty, Polish and Smart people do you know? "1" and that's Me! I have worked under Yates & Associates now Scottish American sense 1992: There have been many people along the years but as a "player agent" I enjoy meeting the needs of our customers request. Most of our agents have worked with me sense the early 90's and I treasure there conversations, shared history and humor. Having an appreciation for claims and loss runs - you think you have the most unusual claim and then one more surprising comes after it. It is a treat to work with all our company representatives and to learn all the different ways of working with SLA in each State. I take pleasure in caring for others at work, home and on a social basis.
