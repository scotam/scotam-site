  dealer, Luke took the Real Estate industry by storm in Bend, OR. Playing in Bend affords him the
  opportunity to explore interesting places, drink craft beer, and meet new people. Luke is a talker,
  and loves to ask questions and researches everything to the Nth degree. You may find him tinkering
  in the garage with the welder, or brushing up on Chomsky or some random Biography with big words.
