biography: >
  Chip joined Scottish American after spending time as retail producer, agency principal, and broker
  for another general agency. Don’t get him started about BBQ as you’re likely to hear any BBQ
  from outside of Texas is just roadkill dipped in Russian salad dressing. When not making dreams come
  true for others, he enjoys family, baseball, football, and Blue Bell ice cream.
