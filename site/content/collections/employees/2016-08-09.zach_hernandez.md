biography: >
  Zach graduated from San Diego State University in May, 2015. He joined the team with the hopes of
  learning the insurance industry while helping out his team in any way he can. He is a big sports fan
  who follows the Kings, Giants, and Vikings through the ups and more common downs. He accepts any
  tips to improve his borderline non-existent golf game.
