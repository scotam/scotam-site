biography: >
  Johnnie is new to the world of insurance but no stranger to quickly adapting to ever-changing
  conditions. He enlisted in the United States Air Force as a Combat Controller after completing his
  Engineering degree in 2007. His second combat tour to the sand box was short lived but went out with
  a bang. Four years and thirty surgeries later, he is constantly seeking out new challenges to crush
  and opportunities to inspire those around him. He enjoys golfing, quoting movies, skydiving,
  scuba-diving, exercising, volunteering, public speaking and especially his giant schnauzer, Argos.
