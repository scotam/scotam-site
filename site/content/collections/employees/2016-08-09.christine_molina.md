biography: 'Christine graduated from Cal State University Fullerton in 2010 with a B.A. in Communications. She was captured by the insurance world in early 2011. She has discovered a great interest in the Professional Lines sector and enjoys a good challenge of finding a home for all risks submitted. She is happily married and is supermom to two beautiful girls- don’t get her started on talking about them unless you plan on staying awhile...they’re her favorite topic of conversation after all. In the very little spare time left after tending to all her grown up responsibilities, you can find her shopping (her second favorite topic, naturally), spending quality time with the family, diving into crafty projects, getting her fix at the coffee shop and recently, traveling to wherever the wind takes her..'
