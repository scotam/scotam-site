biography: >
  Josh entered the insurance industry in 2003 and worked every position from receptionist to vice
  president. Although he says “dude” more than any one person should, don’t be deceived about
  his approach or ability to craft a policy to meet a client’s needs. He is an insurance nerd, often
  found late at night to be reviewing insurance forms, regulations, and quotes only to be awakened at
  3am by nightmares about deductibles and exclusions. Underwriting and providing superior service are
  things he is passionate about. So is finding deals on Amazon. And the Dallas Cowboys. His family
  even has a dog named Romo. But what he lives for is spending time with his awesome family. Josh’s
  idea of a perfect day would consist of waking up to a sweet bind order, hours of fishing with his
  wife and 4 boys, and then a Dallas Cowboys win which would give him an excuse to make a celebratory
  Amazon purchase. Oh, and his wife is an insurance nerd too, so don’t make dinner plans with them
  unless you are either an insurance nerd as well or want to be extremely bored by the table talk.
