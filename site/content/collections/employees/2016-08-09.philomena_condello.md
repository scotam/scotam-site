biography: "I've been working in insurance since I'm 19 years old (25 years) started as a file clerk and worked my way up to underwriting. I have been on the carrier, reinsurance, agent & wholesale side primarily in commercial property but excited to learn all lines. On my spare time I love to be with my husband Tommy & family relaxing by the pool in our yard or on a vacation somewhere in the Caribbean. When I'm not busy driving my daughter Amanda back and forth to dance & dance competitions or helping my stepdaughter Sabrina & future son-in-law Ryan prepare for their wedding."
