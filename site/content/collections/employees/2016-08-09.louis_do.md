biography: >
  Louis is working at Scottish American while simultaneously pursuing a degree in International
  relations. Well, at least that’s the plan for the moment. When he is not bugging fellow Scottish
  Americans with his curious questions, or decrypting Chief Gopher Paul Thomson’s word vomit, he can
  be found strumming his acoustic guitar, headbanging to heavy metal, wandering through the streets of
  Oakland and Berkeley, or engrossed in a historical novel. Speaking of books, he should really get
  back to work on that thriller he has been working on for the last couple of years.
