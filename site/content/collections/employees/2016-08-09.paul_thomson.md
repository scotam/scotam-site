biography: >
  Paul represents Scottish American Capital which was founded in 2009 in order to purchase an
  insurance business. Heâ€™s from Scotland, which means he speaks with an odd accent and tells bad
  jokes. He works about 20 hours a day and spends his free time doing extreme events (like all the
  Tough Mudders) and hangs out with the kids at United Cerebral Palsy. He has an MBA from Harvard
  Business School, is a Chartered Accountant and endlessly asks obvious questions.
