biography: >
  Heather has recently joined Scottish American as a commercial lines underwriter/broker. She has been
  in the industry for over 6 years and is definitely an insurance fanatic; always looking for better
  coverage and lower premiums for her agents. In her past life, she was a bartender and roller derby
  girl so she knows how to play hard, but works even harder. Most of her time is spent cranking out
  quotes in the office, but she loves relaxing at the beach or the golf course on the weekends.
