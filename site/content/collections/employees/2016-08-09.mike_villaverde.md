biography: "Mike is a truly curious individual and loves to know what others do not. As a result, he can tell you the origin of the Dum Dums mystery flavor and a variety of other useless bits of information-courtesy of the History Channel. An extreme connoisseur of comedy, you can often find him in the audience of one of Hollywood's several comedy clubs. Although once hailed as the, “songbird of his generation”, Mike's vocal talents have since diminished and unfortunately, he now only performs in the shower. He has a B.A in Economics and looks forward to a successful career as a Scottish-American!"
