biography: |
  When Andy was 6 years old, he shook hands with Brian "Nasty Boy" Knobbs of the WWF. He told him he could be anything he wanted to be if he ate his vegetables and followed his dreams. Of course this advice inspired Andy to pursue a career in the insurance industry. His most recent focus has been on high net worth personal and surplus lines. When he's not aggressively searching markets to find the best solution for your clients, you will find him chasing his rescue dog Enzo around the dog park or at the auto cross track trying to shave seconds off last weekend's lap time.
