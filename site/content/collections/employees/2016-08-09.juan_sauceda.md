biography: "From Mexico with love, Juan worked in the food industry, starting as a prep in a fancy Mexican restaurant in Soho, and moving up every position at various high and low end bars and restaurants for 10 years, before moving to the insurance business. That's why he only offers the best costumer service, and has learned to laugh and take work, not himself seriously. He loves traveling with his wife, motorcycles, food, shoes, and his friends think he's a beer snob. Go ahead, exchange a binder for a beer with him."
