biography: "Cruncher of Numbers Greg became our Cruncher of Numbers in 2013, after nearly 10 years of crunching numbers in asset management. Which, he says, is similar to the insurance business except for the insurance part. Early in his career, Greg worked for the US government in St. Petersburg, Russia doing super secret things like filing, answering phones and modeling big furry hats. And that's all he’s willing to say about that. Greg likes solving Saturday New York Times crossword puzzles. Seriously, the Saturday ones. In pen. He has an MBA from Cornell University and a BA in Russian from Bucknell University."
