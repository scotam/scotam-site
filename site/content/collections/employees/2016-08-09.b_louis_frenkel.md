  "Teamwork. I do a lot of teamwork." Not only a notable quotable of the one and only Fred Jones of
  Mystery Incorporated but also the personal mantra of B. Louis Frenkel MBA, CPA and all around swell
  guy. When he is not making sure the beans are behaving as they do get out of sorts now and again he
  can be found reading a book, on the Long Beach boardwalk, rooting on his beloved Illini, or at the
  dojo... WAAAAA
