biography: 'Jessie has been a part of the Yates team for over 7 years. She enjoys working in our accounting department. Apparently on her free time she loves to clean her home (really?)& enjoy eating frozen yogurt!! Spending as much time with my family is really important…..as pretty soon I will be having my own little bundle of joy (looks less ‘little’ and more full sized bowling bowl to us)!'
